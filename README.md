## Worksop description


>True or false?: Major political events are regularly covered on live TV, and all of them feature speakers with an agenda.
>
>When the lens of public attention shines on politicians it is important for journalists to be able to contextualise their messages as quickly and effectively as possible.
>
>During this session we will teach participants about open source tools that are being used today by live fact checkers to create annotated transcripts. 
>
>They will learn about how Vox, NPR, and the Financial Times deal with this process. As well as a brand new tool that can be used to annotate and generate these article ready for publication and without having to write a single line of code.
>
>This is an hands on session, drawing on experience from SRCCON '17.
